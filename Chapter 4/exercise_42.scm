;Betty: ``Kitty was second in the examination. I was only third.''
;Ethel: ``You'll be glad to hear that I was on top. Joan was second.''
;Joan: ``I was third, and poor old Ethel was bottom.''
;Kitty: ``I came out second. Mary was only fourth.''
;Mary: ``I was fourth. Top place was taken by Betty.''

"Let B1 be Betty's first statement, B2 her second, E1 Ethel's first statement, and so on.
