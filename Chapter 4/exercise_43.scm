;Exercise 4.43.  Use the `amb` evaluator to solve the following puzzle:

;Mary Ann Moore's father has a yacht and so has each of his four friends:
;Colonel Downing, Mr. Hall, Sir Barnacle Hood, and Dr. Parker. Each of the
;five also has one daughter and each has named his yacht after a daughter
;of one of the others. Sir Barnacle's yacht is the Gabrielle, Mr. Moore owns
;the Lorna; Mr. Hall the Rosalind. The Melissa, owned by Colonel Downing,
;is named after Sir Barnacle's daughter. Gabrielle's father owns the yacht
;that is named after Dr. Parker's daughter. Who is Lorna's father?

;Try to write the program so that it runs efficiently (see exercise 4.40).
;Also determine how many solutions there are if we are not told that Mary
;Ann's last name is Moore.

"In trying to write this program efficiently I solved the puzzle; the answer
is Downing. I find I can't summon the motivation to write an obviously sub-optimal
program to find the solution."
