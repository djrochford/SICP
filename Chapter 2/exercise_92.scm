;Exercise 2.92.  By imposing an ordering on variables, extend the polynomial package
;so that addition and multiplication of polynomials works for polynomials in different
;variables. (This is not easy!)


"This really isn't easy. First we need a way to expand polynomials into an alternate
representation in which no polynomial appears as a coefficient of a term; all
variables need to be out at the same level. Then we need a way to collect terms. Then
we need a way to convert that representation back into our standard polynomial representation
expressing it as a polynomial in a given variable.

I may yet do this, but life is short..."
